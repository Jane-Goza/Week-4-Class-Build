<h1>Issakhanova Gaukhar</h1>
<h5>Hello. My name is Gaukhar. I'm from Kazakhstan. When I was 5 years old my parents sent me to a music school and I understand that my life going to became heavy.I grew up with my piano and notes, participated in many competitions and concerts. But after 17 years I understand that I don't want to be a musician and decided to change my sphere. So I became a student at Fanshawe again, even though I graduated from a university in my own country.</h5>
